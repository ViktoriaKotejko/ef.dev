Small and fast plugin to display in the sidebar a list of linked titles and thumbnails of the most recent postings

== Description ==

The plugin is available in English, German (Deutsch), Persian (Farsi) and Arabic (العربية).

= Lightweight, simple and effective =

No huge widget with hundreds of options. This plugin is based on the well-known WordPress default widget 'Recent Posts' and enhanced to display thumbnails of the posts.

The thumbnails will be built from the featured image of a post or of the first image in the post content. If there is neither a featured image nor a content image then you can define a default thumbnail.

You can set the width and heigth of the thumbnails in the list. The thumbnails appear left-aligned to the post titles in left-to-right languages. In right-to-left languages they appear right-aligned.

= Options you can set =

1. Title of the widget
2. Number of listed posts
3. Hide current post in list
4. Keep sticky posts on top of the list
5. Hide post title
6. Maximum length of post title
7. Show post date
8. Show post excerpt
9. Show number of comments
10. Excerpt length
11. Signs after excerpt
12. Show posts of selected categories (or of all categories)
13. Show post thumbnail (featured image)
14. Registered thumbnail dimensions
15. Thumbnail width in px
16. Thumbnail height in px
17. Keep aspect ratio of thumbnails
18. Try to take the first post image as thumbnail
19. Only use the first post image as thumbnail
20. Use default thumbnail if no thumbnail is available
21. Default thumbnail URL

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the requirements for this plugin? =

The WordPress version should be at least 2.9 to use featured images.

The theme should support `wp_head()` in the HTML header section to print the CSS code for a beautiful alignment of the thumbnails.

= Can I set a default thumbnail? =

Yes.

= Can I set the width and height of the thumbnail? =

Yes. You can enter the desired width and height of the thumbnails or select one of the sizes as set in 'Settings' > 'Media'.

= Can I change the alignment of the thumbnails in the list? =

This feature will come in a future version of the plugin. Set the alignment in the CSS of your theme instead.

= Where can I set the CSS of the list? =

This feature will come in a future version of the plugin. Set the CSS in the style.css of your theme instead.

= Can the plugin take the first image of a post as thumbnail image? =

Yes. It works with images previously uploaded into the media library. You can select to prefer the first image to the featured image or to use the first image only.

= Where is the *.pot file for translating the plugin in any language? =

If you want to contribute a translation of the plugin in your language it would be great! You would find the *.pot file in the 'languages' directory of this plugin. If you would send the *.po file to me I would include it in the next release of the plugin.
